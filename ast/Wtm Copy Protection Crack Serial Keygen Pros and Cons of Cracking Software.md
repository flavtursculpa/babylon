## Step 2: Select the Files You Want to Protect
 
Launch WTM Copy Protection and click on the "Wizard" button. This will guide you through the process of selecting the files you want to protect. You can choose between "File Protection" or "Video Protection". File Protection allows you to protect any type of file with or without document encryption. Video Protection allows you to protect video files with a watermark or a serial number.
 
Click on the "Next" button and browse for the files you want to protect. You can add multiple files or folders by clicking on the "Add" button. You can also remove any file or folder by clicking on the "Remove" button. Click on the "Next" button when you are done.
 
## Step 3: Choose the Protection Method
 
The next step is to choose the protection method for your files. Depending on the type of protection you selected in the previous step, you will have different options available. For example, if you chose File Protection with document encryption, you can choose between "WTM Encryption", "WTM Encryption + Serial Number" or "WTM Encryption + Serial Number + Online Activation". Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, which are explained in detail in the software.
 
Click on the option you want and click on the "Next" button. You will then be asked to enter some settings for your protection method, such as the encryption key, the serial number format, the online activation URL, etc. Enter the settings as per your preference and click on the "Next" button.
 
## Step 4: Create an ISO File
 
The final step is to create an ISO file that contains your protected files and some dummy files that make it harder for hackers to crack your protection. You can choose the number of dummy files by moving the slider or entering a value in the box. You can also choose whether to create a modified autorun file that displays a custom message when detecting illegal copies.
 
Click on the "Next" button and choose a name and location for your ISO file. Click on the "Create ISO" button and wait for the process to finish. You will see a message when your ISO file is ready.
 
## Step 5: Burn Your ISO File to a CD, DVD or USB Drive
 
The last step is to burn your ISO file to a CD, DVD or USB drive using any burning software of your choice. You can also use WTM Copy Protection's built-in burning tool by clicking on the "Burn ISO" button. Insert a blank CD, DVD or USB drive into your computer and select it as the destination. Click on the "Burn" button and wait for the process to finish.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully protected your files with WTM Copy Protection. You can now test your protected media by inserting it into another computer and trying to copy or run your files.
