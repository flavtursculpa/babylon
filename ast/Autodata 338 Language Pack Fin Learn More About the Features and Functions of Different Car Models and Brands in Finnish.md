## Step 1: Choose a Template
 
AudioLabel 5 comes with a large collection of templates for most brands of label paper, including Avery, CD Stomper, Data Becker, Memorex, Neato, PressIt, Staples, SureThing, and TDK. You can also use direct disc printers from Epson, Canon, and HP to print directly on the surface of the disc. To choose a template, simply select your printer type and label paper from the drop-down menus on the main window. You can also adjust the dimensions of any template or create your own custom template using the Edit Dimensions dialog.
 
## Step 2: Add Images and Text
 
AudioLabel 5 lets you add images, photos, backgrounds, and text to your label design with a simple drag and drop. You can use the smart thumbnail viewer to browse images in any folder or search your computer for existing images. You can also use the cool art gallery that comes with AudioLabel 5 to get some inspiration. To add text, just click on the label and start typing. You can use the smart text editor to change the font, size, color, alignment, and style of your text. You can also add special effects such as shadows, outlines, gradients, and transparency.
 
## Step 3: Import CD Information
 
AudioLabel 5 can automatically import your CD information and fill out the label in one step. The Read CD feature can recognize most CDs and find the album information (artist, title, and track list) by searching the Freedb internet database or by reading CD-TEXT from the disc. The Read CD feature can also read and label MP3 CDs using the ID3 tag and filename. To import CD information, just insert your disc into the drive and click on the Read CD button. AudioLabel 5 will then fill out the label with the album information and arrange it on the disc label, front cover, and back cover.
